# MatchGame

A matching game developed in C# as my first project in the language. The goal is to find pairs of matching cards in the shortest time possible.

## How to Play
- Click on two cards to reveal their contents.
- If they are the same, they become visible; if not, they hide again.
- Win by finding all the pairs!

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Compile and run the project.
